      <h1>Sunderban</h1>
      <div id="initial">
         Among other things, it is the unique geography of Sunderbans which endears it to the tourists. It is a part of the world’s largest delta and home to the largest mangrove forests.

It is these, along with the vegetation, that makes this place what it is, a mystery which unfolds itself with every single visit. The vast Sunderbans also houses within it rivers, islands and villages.

Some of the common species of plants which are found include Sundari tree, Golpati, Champa, Dhundul, Genwa and Hatal. It is estimated that there are about 78 species of mangroves in these forests. They are extremely important because of the important role they play in the survival of marine organisms. From a distance, these halophytes exude an aura of mystery, who knows what the darkness within has to offer.
         <h3>Fauna:</h3>
         Wildlife tourism is a major factor behind tourists visiting Sunderbans, and rightly so. After all, you’ve heard that it is home to a rich variety of wildlife, with the Royal Bengal Tigers enjoying a large presence. Nothing makes the tourists more excited than a tiger sighting. While that majestic cat certainly deserves all the attention and spotlight, there are other kinds of birds and wildlife animals who call these mangrove forests their home.

The barking deer also deserves a special mention, as it is found at a place called Haliday Island.
         <h3>Rivers:</h3>
         The Sundarbans delta is formed by the coming together of three rivers, Ganga, Brahmaputra and Meghna. Besides these three main rivers, there are three other rivers which form an intriguing network of channels.
         <h3>Islands:</h3>
         There are a number of islands dotting this region, and some of them are attractions in themselves. The most famous of them are Kalash, Henry and Netidhopani.
